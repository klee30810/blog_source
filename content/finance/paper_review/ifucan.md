## How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly

William J. Bernstein



### Introduction

---

- an investment strategy that a seven-year-old could understand, will take you fifteen minutes of work per year, outperform 90% of finance professionals in the long run.

- Start by saving 15% of salary at age 25 into a 401(k) plan, an IRA, or a taxable account (or all three). Put equal amounts of that 15% into just three different mutual funds:

  > - A U.S. total stock market index fund
  > - An international total stock market index fund
  > - A U.S. total bond market index fund

- Once per year, you'll adjust their amounts so that they're again equal.
- The real reason why you're going to have a crummy retirement is that the conventional "defined benefit" pension plan of your parents' generation, which provided a steady and reliable stream of income for as long as they livd, has gone the way of disco.
- Five hurdles must be overcome if you are to succeed and retire successfully

> 1. People spend too much money
>
> 2. You'll need an adequate understanding of what finance is all about (working knowledge of the theory and practice of finance)
>
> 3. Learning the basics of financial and market history (studying investing history is akin to reading aircraft accident reports)
>
> 4. Overcoming your biggest enemy - Know thyself
>
>    (the failure to maintain strict long-term discipline in saving and investing)
>
> 5. Most "finance professionals" don't even realize that they're moral cripples.



### Hurdle #1 : Even if you can invest like Warren Buffett, if you can't save, you'll die poor

---

- If you're starting to save at age 25 and want to retire at 65, you'll need to put away at least 15% of your salary.
- First, no matter how much debt you have, always, always max out the employer match on you 401(k), 403, or other defined contribution retirement plan.
- Next, eliminate you credit card debt, followed by your car and educational loans.
- Our neighbors *owned* a lot, but didn't *have* a lot.
