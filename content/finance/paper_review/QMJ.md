## Review

---

- **Quality Security** : stocks that are safe, profitable, growing and well managed.
- high quality : higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin
- A quality-minus-junk(QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries
- price-to-book value

$$ \frac{P}{B}=\frac{profitability \times payout.ratio}{required.return - growth} $$

→ scale prices by book values to make them more stationary over time and in the cross section

 - profitability : profits per unit of book value

   	- measure profits in several ways, including **gross profits, margins, earnings, accruals, cash flows, stock's average rank across these metrics**

 - growth : **5-year growth in each of profitability measures**

 - safety : consider both return-based measure of safety (**market beta & volatility**) and fundamental-based measures of safety (**low leverage, low volatility of profitability & low credit risk**)

 - payout : **the fraction of profits paid out to shareholders**

   → a measure of shareholder friendliness

   → higher payout is associated with a lower future profitability or growth

- They need to be **persistent !!!**

- a long sample of U.S. stocks from 1956 to 2012 & broad sample of stocks from 24 developed markets from 1986 to 2012

- The explanatory power of quality on price is limited as the average R2 is only 12% in the long sample and 6% in the broad sample.

  - market prices fail to fully reflect these characteristics for reasons linked to behavioral finance or constraints
  - market prices are based on superior quality characteristics than the ones we consider
  - the quality characteristics are correlated to risk factors not captured in out risk adjustment

- QMJ strategy and HML standar value strategy are negatively correlated.

  - QMJ is buying and selling based on quality characteristics irrespective of stock prices, while HML is buying based on stock prices irrespective of quality
  - Two concepts combined in "quality at a reasonable price (QARP)" : "investment must always the price as well as the quality of the security"
  - QARP is stronger than HML alone as quality is positively associated with future returns, and negatively correlated with value.

- In summary, we complement the literature by showing (i) the theoretical price of quality in a dynamic model; (ii) how quality affects price multiples and how much of the cross-sectional variation of price multiples can be explained by quality; (iii) that the price of quality varies over time and predicts the future return on quality factors; (iv) that quality stocks earn higher returns and yet appear safer, not riskier, than junk stocks, benefitting from flight to quality; and (v) that analysts’ target prices and earnings forecast errors imply systematic quality-related errors in return and earnings expectations.
