# Quality Minus Junk

Asness, C. S., Frazzini, A., & Pedersen, L. H. (2019). Quality minus junk. *Review of Accounting Studies*, *24*(1), 34-112.

## Review

---

- **Quality Security** : stocks that are safe, profitable, growing and well managed.
- high quality : higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin
- A quality-minus-junk(QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries
- price-to-book value

$$ \frac{P}{B}=\frac{profitability \times payout-ratio}{required.return - growth} $$

â†’ scale prices by book values to make them more stationary over time and in the cross section
