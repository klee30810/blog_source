# Understanding Financial Statements

- How valuable are the assets of a firm?

- How did the firm raise the funds to finance these assets?

- How profitable are these assets?

- How much uncertainty (or risk) is embedded in these assets?

  

## The Basic Account Statements

---

### Balance Sheet

- summarizes the assets owned by a firm, the value of these assets and the mix of financing, debt and equity, used to finance these assets at a point in time.

## Asset Measurement & Valuation

---

### Accounting Principles Underlying Asset Measurement

- historical cost, book value : the original cost of the asset
  - An Abiding Belief in Book Value as the Best Estimate of Value
  - A Distrust of Market or Estimated Value
  - A Preference for under estimating value rather than over estimating it

### Measuring Asset Value

1. Fixed Assets
   - require the valuation of fixed assets at historical cost, adjusted for any estimated gain and loss in value from improvements and the aging, respectively, of these assets.
   - Depreciation : reflect the loss of earning power of the asset as it ages
     - straight line & accelerated value
2. Current assets : most amenable to the use of market value
   - Account receivable : money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products on credit
   - bad debts: recognize accounts receivable that are not collectible
3. Cash 
   - fewer and fewer companies actually hold cash in the conventional sense
   - While there is no real default risk in either of these investments, interest rate movements can affect their value.
4. Inventory
   - First-in, First-out : the cost of goods sold is based upon the cost of material bought earliest in the period, while the cost of inventory is based upon the cost of material bought latest in the year.
     - inventory being valued close to the current replacement cost
   - Last-in, First-out : the cost of goods sold is based upon the cost of material bought latest in the period, while the cost of inventory is based upon the cost of material bought earliest in the year
     - finished goods being valued close to the current production cost
   - Weighted Average : both inventory and the cost of goods sold are based upon the average cost of all materials bought during the period
   - LIFO reserve : specify in a footnote the difference in inventory valuation between FIFO and LIFO (since LIFO reduces tax)
5. Investments (Financial) and Marketable Securities : investments made by firms in the securities or assets of other firms
   - Minority, passive investment : less than 20% of the overall ownership of that firm
     - For investments that will be held to maturity, the valuation is at historical cost or book value, and interest expense
     - For investments that are available for sale, the valuation is at market value, but the unrealized gains or losses are shown as part of the equity in the balance sheet and not in the income statement
     - For trading investments, the valuation is at market value and the unrealized gains and losses are shown in the income statement.
   - Minority, active investment : represent between 20% and 50% of the overall ownership of that firm,
   - Majority, active investment : more than 50% of the overall ownership of that firm
     - consolidation : no longer shown as a financial investment but is instead replaced by the assets and liabilities of the firm in which the investment was made
6. Intangible Assets
   1. Patents & Trademarks
      - When patents and trademarks are generated from internal sources, such as research, the costs incurred in developing the asset are expensed
      - when an intangible asset is acquired from an external party, it is treated as an asset.
   2. Goodwill
      - by-products of acquisitions



## Measuring Financing Mix

---

### Accounting Principles Underlying Liability & Equity Measurement

- Strict categorization : to be recognized as a liability
  1. It must be expected to lead to a future cash outflow or the loss of a future cash inflow at some specified or determinable date
  2. The firm cannot avoid the obligation.
  3. The transaction giving rise to the obligation has happened already.

- the value of both liabilities and equity in a firm are better estimated using **historical costs** with accounting adjustments



### Measuring the Value of Liablities & Equities

- Current Liabilities

  1. Accounts Payable : credit received from suppliers and other vendor, book & market value should be similar
  2. Short term borrowing : short term loans (due in less than a year) taken to finance the operations or current asset needs of the business
  3. Short term portion of long term borrowing : portion of the long term debt or bonds that is coming due in the next year
  4. Other short term liabilities : catch-all component for any other short term liabilities ex) wage, tax

- Long Term Debt

  1. long-term loan from a bank or other financial institution : principal (face value) due on the borrowing
  2. long-term bond issued to financial markets : recorded at the issue price, but the premium or discount to the face value is amortized over the life of the bond

- Other Long Term Liabilities

  1. Leases 

     - Operating lease : the lessor (or owner) transfers only the right to use the property to the lessee ⇒ treated as opearting expense & does not affect the balance sheet

     - Capital lease : risks of ownership and enjoys some of the benefits ⇒ recognized both as an asset and as a liability, recognize expenses sooner than equivalent operating leases

       (a) The lease life exceeds 75% of the life of the asset.

       (b) There is a transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

       (c) There is an option to purchase the asset at a "bargain price" at the end of the lease term.

       (d) The present value of the lease payments, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the asset.

  2. Employee Benefits

     - Pension Plans  : 'defined contribution' (wherein a fixed contribution is made to the plan each year by the employer, without any promises as to the benefits which will be delivered in the plan) or a 'defined benefit' (wherein the employer promises to pay a certain benefit to the employee)
     - Health Care Benefits : by making a fixed contribution to a health care plan, without promising specific benefits (analogous to a defined contribution plan), or by promising specific health benefits and setting aside the funds to provide these benefits (analogous to a defined benefit plan)

  3. Deferred Taxes
