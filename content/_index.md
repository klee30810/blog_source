## Kevin's Codex

> 😀 Leonardo Da Vinci's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were **recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings**, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were **made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.**
