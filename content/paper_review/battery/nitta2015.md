- Nitta, N., Wu, F., Lee, J. T., & Yushin, G. (2015). Li-ion battery materials: present and future. *Materials today*, *18*(5), 252-264.



### Abstract

---

- This review covers key technological developments and scientific challenges for a broad range of Li-ion battery electrodes materials : lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium titanium oxide (LTO) and others are contrasted with that of conversion materials, such as alloying anodes (Si, Ge, Sn, etc.), chalcogenides (S, Se, Te), and metal halides (F, Cl, Br, I). The cost, abundance, safety, Li and electron transport, volumetric expansion, material dissolution, and surface reactions for each type of electrode materials are described 



### Introduction

---

- Li-ion batteries are costly at present, and a shortage of Li and some of the transition metals currently used in Li-ion batteries may one day become an issue.
- At the same time, Li-ion batteries have certain fundamental advantages over other chemistries.
  - Li has the **lowest reduction potential of any element**, allowing Li based batteries to have the highest possible cell potential 
  - Li is the **third lightest element and has one of the smallest ionic radii of any single charged ion**. These factors allow Li-based batteries to have high gravimetric and volumetric capaci- ty and power density. 
  - Although multivalent cations allow for higher charge capacity per ion, **the additional charge significantly reduces their mobility.** 
- In terms of absolute quantities, the amount of Li available on the Earthâ€™s crust is sufficient to power a global fleet of automobiles.

- Li is not a major factor in the cost of Li-ion batteries at present. Li is used in the **cathode and electrolyte**, which make up only a **small portion of the overall cost**. Within these components the **cost of processing and the cost of cobalt** in cathodes are the major contributing factors  
- Electrodes with **higher rate capability, higher charge capacity, and (for cathodes) sufficiently high voltage** can improve the energy and power densities of Li batteries and make them **smaller and cheaper**. However, this is only true assuming that the material itself is **not too expensive or rare.** 
- Mn is clearly much cheaper than Co, P and S are much more abundant than the more conductive elements in Groups V and VI, respectively.

-  Figure 2 is a fairly comprehensive form of a popular chart, depicting average electrode potential against experimentally accessible (for anodes and intercalation cathodes) or theoretical (for conversion cathodes) capacity.
